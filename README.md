1-  The goal was to traverse the list until I found the last node, then connect a new node at the end. If the list was empty, I just made the new node the head.
2- Traversed the list until I found the second last node. Then made the next node of that null.
3- Made the second node head which caused the loss of first node.
4- The idea was to keep track of three nodes: previous, current, and next â€” and then flip the direction of each node.
